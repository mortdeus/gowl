// Surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-surface's mode.
// As the exception, setSync and setDesync are effective immediately.

// The main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,
// since it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.
//
// Even if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as
// in synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in
// synchronized mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the
// tree of surfaces. This means, that one can set a sub-surface into
// synchronized mode, and then assume that all its child and grand-child
// sub-surfaces are synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.
//
// If the Surface associated with the Subsurface is destroyed, the
// Subsurface object becomes inert. Note, that destroying either object
// takes effect immediately. If you need to synchronize the removal
// of a sub-surface to the parent surface update, unmap the sub-surface
// first by attaching a NULL Buffer, update parent, and then destroy
// the sub-surface.
//
// If the parent Surface object is destroyed, the sub-surface is
// unmapped.
type Subsurface interface {

	// The sub-surface interface is removed from the Surface object
	// that was turned into a sub-surface with
	// Subcompositor.GetSubsurface request. The Surface's association
	// to the parent is deleted, and the Surface loses its role as
	// a sub-surface. The Surface is unmapped.
	Destroy()

	// This schedules a sub-surface position change.
	// The sub-surface will be moved so, that its origin (top-left
	// corner pixel) will be at the location x, y of the parent surface
	// coordinate system. The coordinates are not restricted to the parent
	// surface area. Negative values are allowed.
	//
	// The next Surface.Commit on the parent surface will reset
	// the sub-surface's position to the scheduled coordinates.
	//
	// If more than one setPosition request is invoked by the client before
	// the commit of the parent surface, the position of a new request always
	// replaces the scheduled position from any previous request.
	//
	// The initial position is 0, 0.

	// This sub-surface is taken from the stack, and put back just
	// above the reference surface, changing the z-order of the sub-surfaces.
	// The reference surface must be one of the sibling surfaces, or the
	// parent surface. Using any other surface, including this sub-surface,
	// will cause a protocol error.
	//
	// The z-order is double-buffered. Requests are handled in order and
	// applied immediately to a pending state, then committed to the active
	// state on the next commit of the parent surface.
	// See Surface.Commit and Subcompositor.GetSubsurface.
	//
	// A new sub-surface is initially added as the top-most in the stack
	// of its siblings and parent.

	// The sub-surface is placed just below of the reference surface.

	// Change the commit behaviour of the sub-surface to synchronized
	// mode, also described as the parent dependant mode.
	//
	// In synchronized mode, Surface.Commit on a sub-surface will
	// accumulate the committed state in a cache, but the state will
	// not be applied and hence will not change the compositor output.
	// The cached state is applied to the sub-surface immediately after
	// the parent surface's state is applied. This ensures atomic
	// updates of the parent and all its synchronized sub-surfaces.
	// Applying the cached state will invalidate the cache, so further
	// parent surface commits do not (re-) apply old state.
	//
	// See Subsurface for the recursive effect of this mode.
	SetSync()

	// Change the commit behaviour of the sub-surface to desynchronized
	// mode, also described as independent or freely running mode.
	//
	// In desynchronized mode, Surface.Commit on a sub-surface will
	// apply the pending state directly, without caching, as happens
	// normally with a Surface. Calling Surface.Commit on the
	// parent surface has no effect on the sub-surface's Surface
	// state. This mode allows a sub-surface to be updated on its own.
	//
	// If cached state exists when Surface.Commit is called in
	// desynchronized mode, the pending state is added to the cached
	// state, and applied as whole. This invalidates the cache.
	//
	// Note: even if a sub-surface is set to desynchronized, a parent
	// sub-surface may override it to behave as synchronized. For details,
	// see Subsurface.
	//
	// If a surface's parent surface behaves as desynchronized, then
	// the cached state is applied on set_desync.
